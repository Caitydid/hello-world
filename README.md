When I graduated from graduate school, the most meaningful present I received was a book of poetry from my social science grassland ecologist friend. She bookmarked "The Wild Geese", and wrote an inscription in the front cover. She said she was giving me that poem because I often needed it, and it was special to her, too. It is one of the most sincere, heartfelt gifts I have ever received.
